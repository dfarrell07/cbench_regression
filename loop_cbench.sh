Run CBench against OpenDaylight in a loop.

Note that the -p/-t option must be given before -l/-r options,
as -l/-r will loop forever, preventing -p/-t from being read.

OPTIONS:
    -h Show this help message
    -l Loop CBench runs without restarting ODL
    -r Loop CBench runs, restart ODL between runs
    -t <time> Run CBench for a given number of minutes
    -p <processors> Pin ODL to given number of processors
